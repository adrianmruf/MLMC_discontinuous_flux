1. Computing a finite volume approximation.
Run the function
`[u,U]=FVM(u0,x,T,sigma,model);`
where `u0` is a vector representing an approximation of the initial datum (use the function `u0=initialdata(x)`), `x` is a discretization of the domain (with length(x)=length(u0)+1), `T` is the end time, sigma is  vector with two entries representing the model parameters for the discontinuous coefficient k, and model can be set to the strings `m1` or `m2` where `m1` corresponds to random position of the flux discontinuity in the Buckley--Leverett equation and `m2` corresponds to random absolute permeabilities to the left and right of a flux discontinuity located at x=0.
The solution can be visualized by running the function
`matplay(getcellmidpoints(x),U,ylimits,T);`

3. Computing the errors.  
Run the script `run_mlmcs.m` from the matlab shell.  
This script loads one of the reference solutions (`testfasitrandposition.mat` for Experiment 1, `testfasitrandabsolutepermeability.mat` for Experiment 2 from the paper), then computes `ntry=30` MLMC estimators E_L[u^L] at levels L=0,..., maxtest (= 6 by default) and compares them to the reference solution.  
The relative errors are stored in the variable `Rk`, the average computation times per estimator in the variable `timeused`, the mesh resolutions at the finest level in the variable `resolutions`, the convergence rate with respect to mesh resolution in `ratemesh`, and the rate with respect to computation time in `ratework`. The variables `Rk`, `vRk` (variance of errors), `timeused`, `ratemesh` and `ratework` are saved into a `.mat` file named `RelativeErrorsfile.mat`.  
The variable `model` can be set to the strings `m1` or `m2` where `m1` will run Experiment 1 from the paper and `m2` will run Experiment 2.
The variable `paralleloption` can be set to 0 or 1, where for the option 1, the inner for loop is replaced by a parfor loop that will distribute the computation of the samples on several cores, if available.


4. Generating a sample of a MLMC estimator.  
Run the function
`[U,V,V2,x,cputime]=mlmc_method(L,model,coarsestmesh,paralleloption);`
where `L` is the number of levels used, `model` has to be set to either `m1` (for Experiment 1) or `m2` (for Experiment 2), 2^coarsestmesh is the resolution at the coarsest level and `paralleloption` can be set to either 0 (normal) or 1 (executes function on several cores if available). 
Output: `U` is an estimate of the mean, `V` and `V2` are estimators of the variance, `x` is a vector containing the grid points and `cputime` is a variable containing the run time.
The MLMC estimator can be visualized by running the function
`jbfill(x,U+sqrt(V),U-sqrt(V));`


5. Generating a reference solution.  
Run the script `compute_gauss_reference.m` from the matlab shell. 
By default it will compute a reference solution to Experiment 1 from the paper and save it as `testfasitrandposition.mat`.   
The variable `model` can be set to the strings `m1` or `m2` where `m1` will run Experiment 1 from the paper and `m2` will run Experiment 2.
